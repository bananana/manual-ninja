# manual-ninja

Simple webapp to display `man` manuals with good typography and layout to make them easier on the eyes. The project is largely inspored by [practicaltypography.com](http://practicaltypography.com/) created by Matthew Butterick.

**Note:** still working on this one, so pardon the appearance. Mostly tested this on Linux, although Mac OS should work as well.

## Setup

This is a fairly straightforward Python Flask setup.

    git clone https://github.com/bananana/manual-ninja
    cd manual-ninja
    virtualenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r reqs.txt

## Running

After setting up the project, simply run the inluded `run.py` script.

    ./run.py
